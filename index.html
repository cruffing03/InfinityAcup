    <h1><i>Infinity ~ Classical Chinese Medicine</i></h1>
    <div class="box">
      <h1>What can we do to help you feel better? <i>THAT</i> is a wonderful question!</h1>
		
		<p>Chinese medicine encompasses not only acupuncture, but also tui na, moxibustion, cupping, external liniments, and internal herbs.</p>
    <p>Each acupuncturist's skill set varies by education and experience. Skill set = success rate.</p>
      <p>Afraid of needles? At our office, we may be able to treat you with a needle-less approach. There are dozens of symptoms, diseases, and injuries that can be eased or even eliminated with Chinese medicine. After all, it <i>does</i> have over 4000 years of evidence-based support for its effectiveness.</p>
		
			<p>Your health is everything. <br>Nutrition, movement, stress management. Good circulation. These create your health and they determine how well you heal. A body that is in disharmony is either in or headed 
			toward disease. At Infinity-CCM, we help you make sense of it all. We 
			meet you where you are currently, and help you find a better pathway forward. We teach you, we speak to groups, and we also 
			make house calls. Schedule today!</p>
